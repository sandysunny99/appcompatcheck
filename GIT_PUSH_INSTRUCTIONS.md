## 🔐 Authentication Issue

The push to GitHub failed because the Personal Access Token (PAT) in the remote URL has expired:

```
remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/sandysunny99/appcompatcheck.git/'
```

## 📝 How to Push Changes to GitHub

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
If you have GitHub CLI installed and authenticated:

```bash
cd /home/runner/app
gh auth login
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Update Remote URL with New Token

1. **Generate a new Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Generate and copy the token

2. **Update the remote URL**:
```bash
cd /home/runner/app
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_NEW_TOKEN@github.com/sandysunny99/appcompatcheck.git
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Use SSH Instead

1. **Set up SSH key** (if not already done):
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # Copy this and add to GitHub
```

2. **Add SSH key to GitHub**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your public key

3. **Change remote to SSH**:
```bash
cd /home/runner/app
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sandysunny99/appcompatcheck.git
git push origin main
```

### Option 4: Push from Local Machine

If you're working in a cloud environment (like Clacky), you can pull the changes to your local machine and push from there:

```bash
# On your local machine
cd path/to/appcompatcheck
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```
