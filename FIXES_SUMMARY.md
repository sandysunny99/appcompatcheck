# Fixes Summary

## User Request
"recheck the entire buttons & redirect accordlinly becaw when i click on few pages buttons are not working &also few are showing the page not found"

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing `/demo` Page (404 Error)
**Issue**: Homepage had a "Watch Demo" button linking to `/demo` which didn't exist.
**Fix**: Created `app/demo/page.tsx` with a comprehensive demo page including:
- Video placeholder
- Feature highlights  
- Use cases for different teams
- Call-to-action section

### 2. Broken `/upload` Page (500 Error)
**Issue**: Upload page was returning 500 errors due to multiple problems:
1. Missing `react-dropzone` package
2. Corrupted `components/file-upload.tsx` file with escaped newlines (`\n\n` instead of actual newlines)
3. Wrong authentication method (used `requireAuth` which throws errors instead of redirecting)
4. Wrong import in `components/ui/radio-group.tsx` (`radix-ui` instead of `@radix-ui/react-radio-group`)

**Fixes**:
- Installed `react-dropzone` package: `npm install react-dropzone`
- Completely rewrote `components/file-upload.tsx` with clean code
- Fixed authentication in `app/upload/page.tsx` to use `getSession()` and `redirect()` instead of `requireAuth()`
- Fixed import in `components/ui/radio-group.tsx` to use correct package name

### 3. Missing `/dashboard` Page (404 Error)
**Issue**: Homepage "Get Started Free" button linked to `/dashboard` which didn't exist.
**Fix**: Created `app/dashboard/page.tsx` with:
- User welcome message
- Quick stats cards (Total Scans, Reports Generated, Account Status)
- Quick action cards with links to Upload, Reports, Docs
- Getting started guide

### 4. Wrong LoadingSpinner Import (500 Errors on Admin Pages)
**Issue**: Three pages were importing `LoadingSpinner` which doesn't exist - the component exports `Loading` instead.
**Affected Files**:
- `app/reports/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/audit/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/monitoring/page.tsx`

**Fix**: Changed all imports from `import { LoadingSpinner }` to `import { Loading }`

### 5. Incorrect Redirect Paths (500 Errors)
**Issue**: Five pages were redirecting to `/auth/login` which doesn't exist (the correct path is `/sign-in`).
**Affected Files**:
- `app/admin/audit/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/monitoring/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/page.tsx`
- `app/reports/page.tsx`
- `app/invite/[token]/page.tsx`

**Fix**: Changed all redirects from `redirect('/auth/login')` to `redirect('/sign-in')`
