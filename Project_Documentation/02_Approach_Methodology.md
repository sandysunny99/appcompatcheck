```

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Code Quality Gates
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality_gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Lint Code
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Type Check
        run: npm run type-check
      - name: Format Check
        run: npm run format:check
```

#### 2. Testing Strategy
```yaml
  test_suite:
    needs: quality_gates
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Unit Tests
        run: npm run test:unit
      - name: Integration Tests
        run: npm run test:integration
      - name: Coverage Report
        run: npm run test:coverage
```

#### 3. Security & Performance
```yaml
  security_performance:
    needs: test_suite
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Security Audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level moderate
      - name: Dependency Check
        run: npm run security:check
      - name: Performance Benchmark
        run: npm run test:performance
```

### Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Blue Environment**: Current production
- **Green Environment**: New version staging
- **Switch Strategy**: DNS/Load balancer flip
- **Rollback**: Immediate switch back to blue

#### Feature Flags
```typescript
// Feature flag implementation
const FeatureFlag = {
  AI_ANALYSIS: process.env.FEATURE_AI_ANALYSIS === 'true',
  ADVANCED_REPORTING: process.env.FEATURE_ADVANCED_REPORTING === 'true',
  REAL_TIME_MONITORING: process.env.FEATURE_REAL_TIME === 'true'
};

// Usage in components
if (FeatureFlag.AI_ANALYSIS) {
  return <AIAnalysisComponent />;
}
```

## Quality Assurance Methodology

### Testing Pyramid Strategy

#### 1. Unit Tests (70% of test suite)
**Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
**Coverage Target**: 90%+
**Focus Areas**:
- Individual component behavior
- Utility function validation
- Business logic verification
- Error handling scenarios

```typescript
// Example unit test
describe('AuthService', () => {
  it('should generate valid JWT tokens', () => {
    const token = AuthService.generateToken({ userId: 1 });
    expect(AuthService.validateToken(token)).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

#### 2. Integration Tests (20% of test suite)
**Tools**: Playwright, Supertest
**Focus Areas**:
- API endpoint testing
- Database integration
- Third-party service mocking
- Component interaction

```typescript
// Example integration test
test('should create user and organization', async ({ request }) => {
  const response = await request.post('/api/auth/register', {
    data: { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'secure123' }
  });
  expect(response.ok()).toBeTruthy();
});
```

#### 3. End-to-End Tests (10% of test suite)
**Tools**: Playwright, Cypress
**Focus Areas**:
- Complete user workflows
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance validation
- Accessibility compliance

```typescript
// Example E2E test
test('complete compatibility scan workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/dashboard');
  await page.click('[data-testid="start-scan"]');
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="scan-results"]');
  expect(page.locator('[data-testid="compatibility-score"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Code Quality Standards

#### ESLint Configuration
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "prettier"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "complexity": ["error", 10],
    "max-lines-per-function": ["error", 50],
    "no-console": "warn",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-any": "error"
  }
}
```

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
- [ ] **Performance**: Are there any performance bottlenecks?
- [ ] **Security**: Are there security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Is the code readable and maintainable?
- [ ] **Testing**: Are appropriate tests included?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is the code properly documented?

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Matrix
