## ⚡ Last Reset Link You Generated

Based on the console, your most recent reset link is:

```
http://localhost:3000/reset-password?token=4df412f2c6395902b6dcf2983cbdf19f177f8e60d9eb64fc0db037c92290cf81
```

**You can use this link RIGHT NOW!**

Just copy it and paste in your browser. It's valid for 1 hour.

## 🤔 Why No Email?

Your `.env` file has this:

```env
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_resend_api_key_here  ← Not a real key!
```

This is a **placeholder**. To receive actual emails, you need to:

1. Sign up at https://resend.com (free, 2 min)
2. Get your API key
3. Replace `your_resend_api_key_here` with your real key
4. Restart the server

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the reset link in console"

1. Make sure terminal is visible (where you ran `npm run dev`)
2. Scroll up to find the link
3. Look for text starting with:
   ```
   Password reset token for...
   Reset link: http://localhost:3000/reset-password?token=...
   ```

### "The link doesn't work"

1. Make sure you copied the **entire** URL
2. Link must include the full token (long random string)
3. Link expires after 1 hour - request a new one
4. Check if Redis is running

### "Still no emails"

- This is expected! Email isn't configured yet
- Console links work perfectly without email
- Follow `SETUP_EMAIL_NOW.md` to enable emails
