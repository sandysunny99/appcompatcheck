## 🔴 About That "535 Authentication Failed" Error

**This is normal!** It means email isn't configured yet.

### Why It Happens:
Your `.env` file has:
```env
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_resend_api_key_here  ← This is a placeholder, not real!
```

It's like trying to log in with password "enter_your_password_here" 😅

**Good news**: Authentication still works! Reset links appear in the console.
