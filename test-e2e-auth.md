### If emails don't arrive in Ethereal:
1. Check terminal for errors
2. Look for "535 Authentication failed"  
3. Verify `.env` has correct credentials:
   ```env
   SMTP_USER=cg3uzdbwzpkkkqy5@ethereal.email
   SMTP_PASSWORD=MTWHAgNq9DUrPMdynm
   ```
4. Restart server if needed

### If login fails:
1. Verify user exists in database
2. Check password is correct
3. Look for error messages in console
4. Check Redis connection

### If password reset fails:
1. Check token hasn't expired (1 hour limit)
2. Verify token hasn't been used already
3. Check Redis connection
4. Look for console errors
