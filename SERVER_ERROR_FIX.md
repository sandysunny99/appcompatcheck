# Internal Server Error Fix ✅

## Issue Reported
User reported: "I can see internal server error"

## Root Cause
The `.next` build cache was corrupted, causing build manifest file errors:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory
Path: .next/server/app/page/app-build-manifest.json
```

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Stop Running Process
```bash
pkill -f "next dev"
```

### Step 2: Clean Build Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
```

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Verification

### Test Results
```bash
# Home page
curl http://localhost:3000/ → 200 OK ✅

# Features pages
GET /features/analysis → 200 OK ✅
GET /scan → 200 OK ✅

# All pages working
No internal server errors ✅
```

### Server Logs
```
✓ Compiled / in 10.1s
GET / 200 in 9500ms ✅
GET /features/analysis 200 in 542ms ✅
GET /scan 200 in 744ms ✅
```

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All pages now load successfully with no internal server errors.

## Prevention

### Common Causes of Build Cache Issues
1. Incomplete builds interrupted
2. File system permissions
3. Rapid file changes
4. Git operations during build

### Best Practices
1. **Clean cache regularly**: `rm -rf .next`
2. **Restart after major changes**: Stop and start dev server
3. **Use turbopack**: Faster and more stable
4. **Monitor logs**: Check for build warnings
