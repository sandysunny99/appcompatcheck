## Report Structure

Generated reports follow this structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "reportId": "RPT-1738104000000",
    "reportType": "comprehensive",
    "generatedAt": "2024-01-28T12:00:00.000Z",
    "generatedBy": 1,
    "organizationId": 1,
    "hostname": "runner-hostname",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "filters": {
    "userId": 1,
    "organizationId": 1
  },
  "summary": {
    "totalScans": 156,
    "totalIssues": 42,
    "criticalIssues": 5,
    "scanSuccessRate": 94.2,
    ...
  },
  "data": { /* detailed scan data */ },
  "statistics": { /* performance scores */ }
}
```

## File Naming Convention

Reports are saved with timestamps in the filename:
- Format: `report-{type}-{timestamp}.json`
- Example: `report-comprehensive-2024-01-28T12-00-00.json`
- Colons are replaced with dashes for file system compatibility

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid session
2. **Permission Checks**: Validates `REPORT_READ` and `REPORT_DELETE` permissions
3. **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents directory traversal attacks in download endpoint
4. **Input Validation**: Validates filenames and request parameters

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. User must be logged in with valid session
2. User must have `REPORT_READ` permission
3. Project must be running: `npm run dev`

# 4. Select report type from dropdown
# 5. Toggle "Include detailed scan data" if needed
# 6. Click "Generate Report" button
# 7. Wait for generation (loading spinner shows)
# 8. Verify report metadata is displayed:
#    - Filename with timestamp
#    - Generation date/time

# Generate a comprehensive report
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/reports/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -d '{
    "reportType": "comprehensive",
    "filters": {
      "userId": 1,
      "organizationId": 1
    },
    "includeDetails": true
  }'

# Expected response:
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "report": { /* full report data */ },
#   "file": {
#     "filename": "report-comprehensive-2024-01-28T12-00-00.json",
#     "path": "/home/runner/app/reports/report-comprehensive-2024-01-28T12-00-00.json",
#     "size": 1234
#   },
#   "message": "Report generated and saved successfully"
# }
```

#### 3. Test List Reports
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/reports/generate \
  -H "Cookie: session=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE"

# Expected response:
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "reports": [
#     {

  -o downloaded-report.json

# Verify the downloaded file contains the report data
cat downloaded-report.json
```

# drwxr-xr-x 2 runner runner 4096 Jan 28 12:00 .
# drwxr-xr-x 15 runner runner 4096 Jan 28 12:00 ..
# -rw-r--r-- 1 runner runner 1234 Jan 28 12:00 report-comprehensive-2024-01-28T12-00-00.json
```

#### 7. Verify Hostname in Report
```bash
# Check the hostname value in generated report
cat reports/report-comprehensive-*.json | grep -A 1 '"hostname"'

# Expected output:
# "hostname": "runner-5e95f2683bef",
```

#### 8. Verify Timestamp Format
```bash
# Check the timestamp in generated report
cat reports/report-comprehensive-*.json | grep -A 1 '"generatedAt"'

# Expected output:
# "generatedAt": "2024-01-28T12:00:00.000Z",
```

## Compilation Status

✅ **All files compile successfully without errors**

Tested pages:
- `/` - Home page: ✅ 200 OK
- `/reports` - Reports page: ✅ 307 Redirect (auth required)
- No TypeScript errors
- No import errors
- No runtime errors during compilation

## Known Limitations

1. **Mock Data**: The report generation currently uses mock/sample data. In production, this should be replaced with actual database queries.

2. **Authentication**: Reports endpoints require authentication. Unauthenticated requests will receive 401/403 errors.

3. **File Storage**: Reports are stored in the `reports/` directory on the server filesystem. Consider cloud storage for production.

4. **Report Cleanup**: No automatic cleanup of old reports. Consider implementing a cleanup job or TTL policy.

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Replace Mock Data**: Integrate with actual database to fetch real scan data
2. **Implement Pagination**: Add pagination for report lists
3. **Add Report Filters**: Allow filtering by date range, type, user, etc.
4. **Cloud Storage**: Move report storage to AWS S3 or similar
5. **Background Jobs**: Generate large reports asynchronously
6. **Email Notifications**: Send email when report is ready
7. **Report Templates**: Add customizable report templates
8. **Export Formats**: Support PDF, Excel, CSV exports
9. **Report Scheduling**: Allow scheduled automatic report generation
10. **Audit Log**: Track who generated/downloaded/deleted reports

## Files Created/Modified
